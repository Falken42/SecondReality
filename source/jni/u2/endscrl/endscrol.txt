Lerto has coded this hilariously fantastic
piece of non-interactive software
entertainment soon available to you all!

There has been quite a fucking lot of
job to be done here and Mika's phone
has been ringing helluva lot.

The guys' daily rhythm has gone haywire, as
they yesterday went to sleep at 6:00 a.m.
and woke up at 13:00. Farkin' great...

Now Pixel (who seemingly Sucks?) has a giant
job to be done: to perfectly smooth a
37-frame animation of a bald man's face
saying "I am not an atomic playboy" ... guess
it'll take days to finish... at least it will
keep him out of our way ;-).

coming up, kids?
A font test!!! Yeah!!!!

ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
1234567890!?;:-,.=+

(why certainly I know my ABC...)
