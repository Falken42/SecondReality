Demo Interrupt Server - For Internal FC distribution
====================================================

Version is 1.0á, this is still in development, and will be untill
< Unreal 2 | [ Rectum ] [Impact] | Potato | ? > is finished.

Read dis.h for function descriptions.

makefile	guess (microsoft nmake)
dis.h		C header file for routines in disc.asm
disc.asm	C interface routines for DIS (also usable from asm)
dis.asm		Resident DIS server main program
disint.asm	Actual DIS interrupt server
distest.c	C test program for DIS
notes		Notes... Nothing special

The disc.asm(obj) is the easiest way to call dis from C. If you want
to call it from asm, see the disc.asm and copy routines from there
or include it to your asm.
